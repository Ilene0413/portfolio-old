                    So where to begin, especially since I don't like writing about myself! 
                    I am divorced for a little over a year, living by myself for the first time, and am loving it!
                    I have 2 sons (28 and 24) and a dog named Cammie, that I love to take on long walks.  I also have a boyfriend for the past
                    4 months, and if you would have told me that a year ago, I would have said you were crazy. The good thing is he makes
                    me feel like I am 25.  
            </p>       
            <p>
                    Now about me.  I am adventurous and love to try new things, which is why I enrolled in the bootcamp. I also enjoy
                    amusement parks, especially riding the roller coasters in the rain - I have done this for the past two Mother's Days with my
                    younger son at Six Flags Over New England.  I love to hike and recently took a hike in the Virgin River in Zion National Park 
                    (yes - it was in the water and 40 degrees outside). The next day I took a strenuous hike in Bryce Canyon in the snow.
            </p>

                    Other favorite things are the beach - especially watching the sunset and taking walks along the shore; going to the movies -
                    will watch almost anything except sci-fi, doing puzzles of all types - I finished a 2000 piece jigsaw puzzle and 
                    am working on another one, and baking - recently I have been baking lots of chocolate chip cookies and brownies. Last thing, is my
                    favorite foods are pizza and ice cream - can never turn them away.
